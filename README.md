# VueJS_Tutorial
## Introduction
1. Vue JS is a Javascript Framework
2. You can use Vue JS for Standalone Widget or Single Page Application.
##### What is a Standalone Widget
-> You can create a Login Widget and drop it onto any webpage, built on any framework. It's like adding a Hazard Light to your Motorcycle's existing Headlights.

##### What is a Single Page Application
-> On slow webpages, you have to send a request to the server to receive a webpage. If a link is being clicked within that webpage, you have to send a request again to receive another component.\
To solve this issue, if a Webpage is built with Vue JS, A Barebone HTML page and a Vue Javascript Bundle is automatically downloaded from the server.\
So when you click a Link, it is Routed through Vue JS Bundle and required components are loaded automatically. 
That means a Single Barebones HTML code is downloaded, latter parts are controlled through Vue JS Bundle.\
